    <h2>Profile:</h2>
    <p>I'm an experienced administration  professional, dedicated to providing exceptional service to clients and colleagues alike. I pride myself on efficient systems, an approachable and helpful attitude, and successfully ensuring professionals in the field can focus on their core responsibilities rather than being distracted by form-filling, travel booking, and other such necessary but mundane tasks. I'm looking for a role where I have flexibility to improve systems, with a friendly and supportive office culture.</p>

        <p>The first evacuation was in my second year at university. Heat pulsated through the smoke-heavy air. My small backpack contained my laptop, textbooks for the semester, a change of clothes, and an almost-full bottle of vodka. We queued onto buses, the ones they usually use for school-runs with uncomfortable, thread-bare seats, and they drove us three hours away, where we bedded down in a school hall for the night.</p>
        <p>We were back the next day, the fires under control. But the evacuations became more frequent. Fires flared threateningly at the edges of cities, swallowing outer suburbs. Climate change, people said, knowingly. People can get used to most things, I found, and we learned to make the most of these impromptu journeys, a break in routine. There was an unspoken rule that if you made an idiot of yourself, no-one mentioned in when you got back.</p>
        <p>I didn't realise that anything about me was changing.</p>
